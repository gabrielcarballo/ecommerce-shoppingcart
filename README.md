# Dynamic Shopping Cart Project

This project is a demonstration of my skills in JavaScript, learned at my bootcamp. It includes various functions and unit tests to ensure their correct operation. The project is a fully dynamic shopping cart that consumes data directly from an API.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a shopping cart that fetches data from the Mercado Livre API. The goal is to ensure that the shopping cart functions correctly, following the requirements outlined in each statement. Additionally, it encourages a test-driven development approach, also known as TDD (Test Driven Development), which helps to ensure quality code, understanding the use cases of your application and ensuring that it is working correctly.

## Development

The project includes the following functionalities:

- **fetchProducts():** This function fetches a list of products from the Mercado Livre API.
- **fetchItem():** This function fetches details of a specific product from the Mercado Livre API.
- **saveCartItems():** This function saves the items added to the shopping cart in the localStorage.
- **getSavedCartItems():** This function retrieves the items saved in the shopping cart from the localStorage.
- **addProductToCart():** This function adds a product to the shopping cart.
- **removeProductFromCart():** This function removes a product from the shopping cart.
- **calculateTotalPrice():** This function calculates the total price of the items in the shopping cart.
- **clearCart():** This function clears the shopping cart.

## Project Requirements

## Project Requirements

1. (TDD) Develop tests with at least 25% total coverage and 100% coverage for the `fetchProducts` function. Implement the necessary tests in the `fetchProducts` function.
2. Create a product listing. Use the `fetchProducts` function to create a product listing through the Mercado Livre API.
3. (TDD) Develop tests with at least 50% total coverage and 100% coverage for the `fetchItem` function. Implement the necessary tests in the `fetchItem` function.
4. Add the product to the shopping cart. Implement the `fetchItems` function to return product data and add it to the cart.
5. Remove the item from the shopping cart by clicking on it. When clicking on the product in the shopping cart, it should be removed from the list.
6. (TDD) Develop tests with at least 75% total coverage and 100% coverage for the `saveCartItems` function. Implement the necessary tests in the `saveCartItems` function.
7. (TDD) Develop tests to achieve 100% total coverage and 100% coverage for the `getSavedCartItems` function. Implement the necessary tests in the `getSavedCartItems` function.
8. Load the shopping cart when the page starts. Save the items added to the shopping cart in localStorage.
9. Calculate the total value of the items in the shopping cart. The element with the total value of the products must have the `total-price` class.
10. Clear the shopping cart. Implement the logic in the "Empty cart" button to clear the shopping cart.
11. Add a loading text during a request to the API. Add an element with the text "loading..." during the request to the API.
